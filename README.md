Stealth_em_up
=============


## Next:
  
* Different Weapons (Pistol, Silenced Pistol[done], Taser, Melee[done])
* icon for changing weapons

* (e)Guard Backup
* (m)Guard attack when on alert
* (e)Hero Health
* (e)Make loot drop work with score
* crouch and hide behind desks
* drive car
* pause
* Make Civs avoid restricted areas.


  
## Eventually:
* Sound
* Loose Focus Markers (highlight the side of the screen red, where the mouse left off)

## Brad Recommends:
* Tutorial Levels (Really work on doing it right, don't just make one for the sake of it)
* ammo
* Turn off laser sight
* multiple buildings
* cop cars driving by
* health bar
* randomize daytime and nighttime
* incapacitate guards (for time?) (for the challenge of doing it the harder way)
* (h) lights (shoot out lights)
* blood pool when guard is 
* place to dispose bodies (dumpster)
* multiple ways to dispose of a body (burn for 15 seconds)
* guards have health bars and don't die in one shot
* time clock
* blood splatter (on desks and flood)

## Notes:
* SpriteBatch is a super charged display object container
* Setting the CacheAsBitmap flag makes a display object's content (children) be rentered to a texture, and then that texture is drawn.  With CacheAsBitmap on, children's rotation (for example) is excluded.

* Drag code is updated in CodePractice repo.
