Added a break statement which fixed a bug where hero would slow down too much if he tried
to drag a dead body when more than one dead body was around.
Changed click listener to on mouse down for more responsive shooting

major: PATHFINDING
minor: made screen bigger
increase sprite speed
new map for pathing
commented out guard agro to test path finding
guards now move only when they have a path
when hero shoots gun, path is created from guards to hero and they go to where they 
heard the shot.

//
guards can become alerted, and stop moving when they see you.
bug: fixed a weird issue when walking into a guard who notices you sets hero back to 0,0.  This must have something to do with javascript.
  I called guards[i].target = hero; rather than guards[i].target = {x: hero.x, y: hero.y}; I think target became a pointer for hero and then
   target.x and .y got set to null or 0 or something.
Guards rotate to follow hero with sight.
Sprites rotate to face target.

Couldn't get the following to work:
  //test blood trail
    var painting = new PIXI.Sprite(img_blank);
    painting.texture.removeAllEventListeners();
    painting.texture.frame = new PIXI.Rectangle(0,0,grid.width*grid.cell_size,grid.height*grid.cell_size);
    //painting.cacheasbitmap = true;
    var follower = new PIXI.Sprite(img_money);
    painting.addChild(follower);
    stage.addChild(painting);
    
    function snap(){
        var snapshot = painting.generateTexture();
        painting.setTexture(snapshot);
    }
    //end test blood trail
